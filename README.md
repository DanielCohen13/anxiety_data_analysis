## Neta & Daniel project - Behind the Headlines: Exploring Fake News
Welcome to Neta and Daniel's project!

In this project, we analyze a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake, from different media sources.
Our goal is to find clear patterns that separate fake news from real news by looking at features like clickbait level, trust score, political bias, and more

Enjoy the content :)

# Tasks:
- לאסוף כמה שיותר תובנות ושאלות

# Datasets code links:
- Fake News (Kaggle) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/fake-news-detection/data
- 
# Questions & Thoughts:
- איך מתחלקות הכתבות ל־Fake ו־Real (label)?
- מהם המאפיינים הבולטים של כתבות מזויפות לעומת אמיתיות?
- אילו מקורות מייצרים יותר Fake?
- האם כתבות עם ציון אמון גבוה עדיין יכולות להיות Fake?
- האם כתבות עם ציונים מאוד גבוהים של קריאות (readability) דווקא Fake כי הן "עוברות טוב"?
- האם דווקא כתבות סאטיריות מתויגות לעיתים בטעות כ־Fake?


# Insights:

# General Analysis Ideas
1. Distribution of Fake vs Real news

- Visualization: Pie chart or bar plot.

2. Top sources and their credibility

- Which sources publish the most fake/real news?

- Do sources with lower source_reputation publish more fake news?

- Visualization: Stacked bar charts, grouped bar plots.

3. Sentiment analysis

- Do fake articles tend to be more negative or positive than real ones?

- Visualization: Box plots of sentiment_score by label.

4. Clickbait and Fake News

Are fake news articles more clickbaity?

Visualization: Histograms or violin plots of clickbait_score.

How do plagiarism_score and trust_score relate to article authenticity?

Visualization: Scatter plots or correlation heatmaps.

# 🧠 Advanced / Pattern Analysis Ideas
6. Fact-checking vs Reality

How well does the fact_check_rating align with the actual label?

Visualization: Confusion matrix-style plot or stacked bar.

7. Political Bias and News Type

Visualization: Heatmap or grouped bars.

8. Content Features: Length and Multimedia

Are longer articles more trustworthy?

Does having images/videos affect credibility?

Visualization: Grouped bars or violin plots.

# 🧪 Ideas for your main project direction
Here are 3 solid theme ideas:

1. "Fake News Patterns Across Media Sources"
Focus on how source reputation, trust score, and clickbait level relate to fake vs real news.

2. "How Political Bias Affects Fake News Distribution"
Dig into how articles with political leanings (left, center, right) compare in terms of authenticity, tone, and credibility.

3. "Can You Spot Fake News? A Feature-Based Exploration"
Explore whether variables like word count, sentiment, clickbait, and plagiarism can be used to distinguish fake news.
